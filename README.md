# The Lost Pendulum

This repository contains the core C# scripts used to create **my first Unity game**, *The Lost Pendulum*. Due to Unity project size limitations and GitHub's file upload constraints, the full project directory could not be committed. However, these scripts represent the majority of the gameplay logic and puzzle mechanics developed during the project.

> Note: The full Unity project is not included, so this repository cannot be cloned and opened directly in the Unity Editor.
